## SWAPI-Box

This project involves developing advanced concepts of React components. It utilizes the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.co/documentation "Star Wars API") to make asnycronous fetch calls, gaining access to a dense data structure. Jest and Enzyme are used for testing. This project uses SCSS for styling and was initialized using the `create-react-app` boilerplate. 

On page load an opening text scroll is chosen at random to display on the page. The user can then click on any of the three category buttons, "PEOPLE", "VEHICLES" or "PLANETS, to present the respective content cards. By clicking the star button on any of the cards, the specified card will be added to the favorites content, accessible by the button in the upper right.
